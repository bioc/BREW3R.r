\usage{
adjust_for_collision(input_gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_gr}{A GRanges with 2 metas: 'old_start' and 'old_end'}
}
\value{
A list with:
        - 'pot_issues': A dataframe with overlaps between `input_gr`
                        and itself while gene_ids are different
        - 'new_gr': A GRanges identical to `input_gr` except that start/end
                    have been adjusted to prevent collisions.
}
\description{
A function that from a GRanges with 'old_start' and 'old_end'
